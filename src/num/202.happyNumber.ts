/** Hash Table, Math, Two Pointers

    Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

    A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
    Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 19
    Output: true
    Explanation:
    12 + 92 = 82
    82 + 22 = 68
    62 + 82 = 100
    12 + 02 + 02 = 1

    Example 2:
    Input: n = 2
    Output: false
    
    Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 231 - 1

function isHappy(n: number): boolean {
    const seen = new Set<number>();

    while (n !== 1 && !seen.has(n)) {
        seen.add(n);
        n = getSumOfSquares(n);
    }

    return n === 1;
}

// Helper function to compute the sum of the squares of the digits
function getSumOfSquares(num: number): number {
    let sum = 0;

    while (num > 0) {
        const digit = num % 10;
        sum += digit * digit;
        num = Math.floor(num / 10);
    }

    return sum;
